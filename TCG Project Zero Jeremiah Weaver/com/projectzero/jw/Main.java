/* Not sure how to the packages work.  I thought I understood then I went to try to work with a package and got a little
 lost.  I also tried to add an external library and thought I got something wrong.
 So I decided to go back to some basics till I am able to ask some questions.  had an issue where I guess I created a new
 final project and put it into a different file folder.  I was unable to add, commit, and push the new files until I found
 where the base file was stored and moved the file now I can add, commit, and push the new project.  However, I am not sure
 if all of my classes are supposed to be attached to the README file instructions or if they are supposed to be separated.
 on that note I am note, sure if my classes are supposed to be one on top of another like my methods of if each class needs
  to be a different file for each class for readability a different file is better, but for access one "page" makes more
  sense.  Unable to add and commit this project file.*/
